== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it safe to run PHP code snippets? =

Vira Code includes several safety features:
- PHP code validation before execution
- Error handling with automatic snippet disabling
- Safe Mode to disable all snippets instantly
- Execution logs for debugging

However, always test snippets in a development environment first.

= What happens if a snippet causes an error? =

If a snippet causes an error:
1. The error is logged with details
2. The snippet is automatically marked as "error" status
3. After multiple errors, Safe Mode may be auto-enabled
4. You can use the emergency Safe Mode URL to disable all snippets

= Can I use this on a production site? =

Yes, but always:
- Test snippets thoroughly before activating
- Keep backups of your site
- Use Safe Mode if issues occur
- Monitor execution logs regularly

= How do I enable Safe Mode in an emergency? =

You can enable Safe Mode by:
1. Visiting: `yoursite.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=vira-code-settings&vira_safe_mode=1`
2. Using the toggle button in Settings
3. Checking the Safe Mode checkbox and saving settings

= Does this work with caching plugins? =

Yes, but you may need to clear your cache after activating/deactivating snippets to see changes take effect.

= Can I export/import snippets? =

Currently, snippets are stored in the database. Import/export functionality may be added in future versions. You can use the REST API to programmatically backup and restore snippets.
